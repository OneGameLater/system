# Ancestries

### Ancestry Traits

The description of each ancestry includes traits that are common to members of that ancestry. The following entries appear among the traits of most ancestries.

#### Ability Score Increase

Every ancestry increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

#### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the ancestry is considered an adult, as well as the ancestry’s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Size

Characters of most ancestries are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few ancestries are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in “Equipment.”

#### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling ( “Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).

#### Languages

By virtue of your ancestry, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

#### Heritages
Some races have a number of varied heritages. Members of a given heritage have the traits of the parent ancestry in addition to the traits specified for their heritage. Relationships among heritages vary significantly from ancestry to ancestry and world to world.
